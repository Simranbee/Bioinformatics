# Bioinformatics
This repository is some of my code that I use for bioinformatics related projects.   It includes the code I use for preprocessing data on the linux server, as well as some EDA done in jupyter notebook.

I plan on including the R code done for my masters thesis, however because the project isn't published yet, no results/visualizations can be posted here.
